/**
 * Working on the gameplay
 * -----------------------
 * Description
 * An interesting idea has come to your mind. Let's change the rules of game. Players take turns taking X pencils until
 * none of them remain.
 * -----------------------
 * Objectives
 * Expand your program by creating a loop. Each player takes turns removing pencils until 0 pencils remain on the table.
 * Each iteration prints 2 lines: lines with pencils (vertical bars) and whose turn is now by printing the *NameX*'s
 * turn string. If there are no pencils left after a player's move, the loop breaks and the game ends without any
 * additional output.
