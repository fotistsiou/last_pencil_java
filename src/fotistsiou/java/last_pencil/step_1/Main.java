/**
 * Empty the pencil case
 * ---------------------
 * Description
 * You and your friend decided to play a simple pen-and-paper game. There's one catch â€” you have only pencils but no
 * paper; the last piece of paper is gone for your beautiful drawings. As a joke, your friend pulls all the pencils
 * out of the case onto the table and says: "Your turn!"
 * ---------------------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, your program should print two lines: one line with several vertical bar symbols representing pencils
 * (for example, ||| or |||||||) and one Your turn! string.
