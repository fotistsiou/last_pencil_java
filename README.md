## About
Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable. Invite a friend to play the Last 
Pencil, a game where you decide who wins. In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. 
But it's up to you to choose who wins.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

* Stage 1/5: Empty the pencil case
  * It was a boring day, so your friend came up with the idea of creating a simple game.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Introduction to Java
    * Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
    * Writing first program
    * Printing data
* Stage 2/5: New rules
  * Let's change the game a little bit and add new conditions.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Types and variables
    * Comments
    * Reading user's input with Scanner
    * Coding style conventions
    * Naming variables
    * Arithmetic operations
    * Integer types and operations
    * Increment and decrement
    * Data types and their sizes
    * Type casting
    * Floating-point types
    * Boolean type and operations. True and false
    * Comparing values. Relational operators
    * Conditional statement
    * Characters
    * String
* Stage 3/5: Working on the gameplay
  * You've decided to try out new game mechanics and take turns until no pencils remain.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Calling methods
    * One-line condition with ternary operator
    * While and do-while loops
    * For loop
    * Break and continue. Branching
    * Declaring methods
    * Method "main"
    * Multiple conditions: switch
    * Functional decomposition
    * Primitive and reference types
    * Array
    * What is object-oriented programming
    * Processing strings
* Stage 4/5: Fair play
  * You took all the pencils in one turn. Your friend decided that it was unfair and somehow took a negative number of 
    pencils! Who is the winner? Let's add the winning condition!
  * Stage Topics:
    * Write, compile, and run
    * Errors in programs
* Stage 5/5: The right strategy
  * You've played several games and found out that there's only one winning strategy. Your friend suggested implementing 
    a bot to add a certain degree of randomness to the game.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Defining classes
    * Objects and their properties
    * Random class
